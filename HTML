<p><span><b>Wind Personality Type</b></span>
<br>
They form an interesting personality as on one hand they are extremely enthusiastic to attain whatever they wish or desire on the other hand, they are not passionately attached to their objectives or desires. Children named after the air element sort of live the characteristics that define agility and fantasy.</p>

<p><span><b>Water personality</b></span> 
     <br>
Water types are articulate, clever and introspective, self-contained and self-sufficient. They are penetrating, critical and scrutinising, seeking knowledge and understanding. They like to remain hidden, enigmatic and anonymous.  </p>

<hr>
<caption><b>3.Earth</b></caption>
<br>

<p><span><b>Earth personality</b></span>
    <br>
Earth represents the physical and grounded structure and material values. The Earth type personalities are methodical, reliable, loyal, practical, hard working, structured, patient, strategic, careful, often rule bound and rely quite heavily to set routines or rhythms. </p>

<p><span> <b>Fire personality</b></span>
<br>
    Signs are known for their passion, creativity, spontaneity, inspiration, and competitive spirit. “Overall, [they] desperately need to be inspired to be happy,” says Donna Page, a professional astrologer with a graduate degree in counseling psychology.</p>

<br>
<P> <span><b> Space personality </b></span>
<br>
    It has qualities, based more on the absence of its opposing quality than on the actual quality itself. Space people are light because they lack the heaviness created by earth and water personality. They are also subtle because they lack the profound presence of the more obvious elements.</P>
